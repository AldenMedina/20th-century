"The20th centurywas the century that began on  1 January1901(MCMI), and ended on 31 December2000(MM).It was the 10th and last century of the2nd millenniumand was marked by new models of scientific understanding, unprecedented scopes of warfare, new modes of communication that would operate at nearly instant speeds, and new forms of art and entertainment.Population growthwas also unprecedented,as the century started with around 1.6 billion people, and ended with around 6.2 billion."
"The 20th century was dominated by significant geopolitical events that reshaped the political and social structure of the globe:World War I, theSpanish flu pandemic,World War IIand theCold War. Unprecedentedadvances in science and technologydefined the century, including the advent ofnuclear weaponsandnuclear power,space exploration, theshift from analog to digital computingand the continuing advancement of transportation, includingpowered flightand theautomobile. The Earth's sixth mass extinction event, theHolocene extinction, continued, and humanconservation effortsincreased."
"Major themes of the century includeddecolonization,nationalism,globalizationand new forms ofintergovernmental organizations.Democracyspread, andwomen were given the right to votein many countries in the world.Cultural homogenizationbegan through developments in emerging transportation andinformation and communications technology, withpopular musicand other influences ofWestern culture,international corporations, and what is arguably a trulyglobal economyby the end of the 20th century. Poverty was reduced and the century saw rising standards of living,world populationgrowth, awareness ofenvironmental degradationandecological extinction.Automobiles,airplanes, andhome appliancesbecame common, andvideoandaudio recordingsaw mass adoption. These developments were made possible by the exploitation offossil fuelresources, which offered energy in an easily portable form, but also caused concern about pollution and long-term impact on theenvironment. Humans started to explorespace, taking their first footsteps on theMoon. Great advances inelectricity generationandtelecommunicationsallowed for near-instantaneous worldwide communication, ultimately leading to theInternet. Meanwhile, advances inmedical technologyresulted in the near-eradication anderadication of many infectious diseases, as well as opening the avenue of biologicalgenetic engineering. Scientific discoveries, such as thetheory of relativityandquantum physics, profoundly changed the foundational models of physical science, forcing scientists to realize that the universe is more complex than previously believed, and dashing the hopes (or fears) at the end of the 19th century that the last few details of scientific knowledge were about to be filled in."
"At the beginning of the period, theBritish Empireis the world's most powerful nation,havingacted as the world's policemanfor the past century."
"Technological advancements duringWorld War Ichanged the way war is fought, as new inventions such astanks,chemical weapons, and aircraft modified tactics and strategy. After more than four years oftrench warfarein Western Europe, and up to 17 million dead, the powers that had formed theTriple Entente(France,Britain, andRussia, later replaced by the United States and joined byItalyandRomania) emerged victorious over theCentral Powers(Germany,Austria-Hungary, theOttoman EmpireandBulgaria). In addition to annexing many of thecolonial possessionsof the vanquished states, the Triple Entente exacted punitive restitution payments from them, plunging Germany in particular intoeconomic depression. The Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires were dismantled at the war's conclusion. TheRussian Revolutionresulted in the overthrow of theTsaristregime ofNicholas IIand the onset of theRussian Civil War. The victoriousBolsheviksthen established theSoviet Union, the world's firstcommunist state."
"Fascism, a movement which grew out of post-warangstand which accelerated during theGreat Depressionof the 1930s, gained momentum inItaly,Germany, andSpainin the 1920s and 1930s, culminating inWorld War II, sparked byNazi Germany's aggressive expansion at the expense of its neighbors. Meanwhile,Japanhad rapidly transformed itself into a technologically advanced industrial power and, along with Germany and Italy, formed theAxis powers. Japan's militaryexpansionismin East Asia and the Pacific Ocean brought it into conflict with the United States, culminating ina surprise attackwhich drew the US into World War II."
"After some years of dramatic military success, Germany isdefeatedin 1945, having beeninvadedby theSoviet UnionandPolandfrom the Eastand by the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, andFrancefrom the West. After the victory of theAlliesin Europe, thewar in Asiaended with theSoviet invasion of Manchuriaand thedropping of two atomic bombson Japan by the US, the first nation to developnuclear weaponsand the only one to use them in warfare. In total, World War II left some 60 million people dead."
"Following World War II, theUnited Nations, successor to theLeague of Nations, is established as an international forum in which the world's nations could discuss issues diplomatically. It enactedresolutionson such topics as the conduct of warfare, environmental protection, internationalsovereignty, and human rights.Peacekeepingforces consisting of troops provided by various countries, with various United Nations and other aid agencies, helped to relieve famine, disease, and poverty, and to suppress some local armed conflicts. Europe slowly united, economically and, in some ways, politically, to form theEuropean Union, which consisted of 15 European countries by the end of the 20th century."
"After the war, Germany isoccupiedand divided between theWesternpowers and the Soviet Union.East Germanyand the rest ofEastern Europebecame Sovietpuppet statesunder communist rule. Western Europe is rebuilt with the aid of the AmericanMarshall Plan, resulting in a majorpost-war economic boom, and many of the affected nations became close allies of the United States."
"With the Axis defeated and Britain and France rebuilding, the United States and the Soviet Union were left standing as the world's only superpowers. Allies during the war, they soon became hostile to one another as their competing ideologies ofcommunismanddemocratic capitalismproliferated in Europe, which became divided by theIron Curtainand theBerlin Wall. They formed competing military alliances (NATOand theWarsaw Pact) which engaged in a decades-long standoff known as theCold War. The period is marked by anew arms raceas the USSR became the second nation to develop nuclear weapons, which were produced by both sides in sufficient numbers toend most human life on the planethad a large-scale nuclear exchange ever occurred.Mutually assured destructionis credited by many historians as having prevented such an exchange, each side being unable tostrike firstat the other without ensuring an equally devastatingretaliatory strike. Unable to engage one another directly, the conflict played out in a series ofproxy warsaround the world—particularly inChina,Korea,Cuba,Vietnam, andAfghanistan—as the USSR sought toexport communismwhile the US attempted tocontain it. The technological competition between the two sides led to substantial investment inresearch and developmentwhich produced innovations that reached far beyond the battlefield, such asspace explorationand the Internet."
"In the latter half of the century, most of theEuropean-colonized worldin Africa and Asia gained independence in a process ofdecolonization. Meanwhile,globalizationopened the door for several nations to exert a strong influence over many world affairs. The US's global military presence spreadAmerican culturearound the world with the advent of theHollywood motion picture industryandBroadway,jazz, rock music, and pop music, fast food andhippycounterculture,hip-hop,house music, anddisco, as well asstreet style, all of which came to be identified with the concepts of popular culture andyouth culture.Afterthe Soviet Union collapsedunder internal pressure in 1991, most of the communist governments it had supported around the worldwere dismantled—with the notable exceptions of China,North Korea,Cuba,Vietnam, andLaos—followed bydifficult transitionsintomarket economies."
"Due to continuing industrialization and expanding trade, many significant changes of the century were, directly or indirectly, economic and technological in nature. Inventions such as thelight bulb, theautomobile,mechanical computers, and thetelephonein the late 19th century, followed bysupertankers;airliners;motorways;radio communicationandbroadcasting;television;digital computers;air conditioning;antibiotics;nuclear power;frozen food;microcomputers; theInternetand theWorld Wide Web; andmobile telephonesaffected people'squality of lifeacross the developed world. The quantity of goods consumed by the average person expanded massively. Scientific research, engineering professionalization and technological development—much of it motivated by theCold Wararms race—drove changes in everyday life."
"Starting from the century, strong discrimination based on race and sex is significant in most societies. Although theAtlantic slave tradehad ended in the 19th century, movements for equality for non-white people in the white-dominated societies ofNorth America, Europe, andSouth Africacontinued. By the end of the 20th century, in many parts of the world, women had the same legal rights as men, and racism had come to be seen as unacceptable, a sentiment often backed up by legislation.When theRepublic of Indiaisconstituted, the disadvantaged classes of thecaste system in Indiabecame entitled toaffirmative actionbenefits in education, employment and government."
Attitudes toward pre-marital sex changed rapidly in many societies during thesexual revolutionof the 1960s and 1970s. Attitudes towards homosexuality also began to change in the later part of the century.
"Trauma brought on by events like World War I and World War II, with theirmilitary death tollsaloneat bare minimumbeing 29,697,963, and theSpanish Flu, whose death count alone exceeded that, helped make society in many countries moreegalitarianand less neglectful of the poor."
"Economic growth and technological progress had radically altered daily lives. Europe appeared to be at a sustainable peace for the first time in recorded history. The people of theIndian subcontinent, a sixth of the world population at the end of the 20th century, had attained anindigenous independencefor the first time in centuries. China, an ancient nation comprising a fifth of the world population, is finallyopen to the world, creating a new state after the near-complete destruction of the old cultural order. With the end of colonialism and the Cold War, nearly a billion people in Africa were left in new nation states."
"The world is undergoing its second major period ofglobalization; the first, which started in the 18th century, having been terminated by World War I. Since the US is in a dominant position, a major part of the process isAmericanization. The influence of China and India is also rising, as the world's largest populations were rapidly integrating with the world economy."
"Terrorism, dictatorship, and the spread ofnuclear weaponswere pressingglobal issues. The world is still blighted by small-scale wars and other violent conflicts, fueled by competition over resources and by ethnic conflicts."
"Disease threatened to destabilize many regions of the world. New viruses such as theWest Nile viruscontinued to spread.Malariaand other diseases affected large populations. Millions were infected with HIV, the virus which causes AIDS. The virus is becoming anepidemic in southern Africa."
"Based on research done by climate scientists, the majority of the scientific community consider that in the long term environmental problems pose a serious threat.One argument is that ofglobal warmingoccurring due to human-caused emission ofgreenhouse gases, particularlycarbon dioxideproduced by the burning offossil fuels.This prompted many nations to negotiate and sign theKyoto treaty, which set mandatory limits on carbon dioxide emissions."
World populationincreased from about 1.6 billion people in 1901 to 6.1 billion at the century's end.
"The number of people killed during the century by government actions is in the hundreds of millions. This includes deaths caused by wars, genocide, politicide and mass murders. The deaths from acts of war during the two world wars alone have been estimated at between 50 and 80 million.Political scientistRudolph Rummelestimated 262,000,000 deaths caused bydemocide, which excludes those killed in war battles, civilians unintentionally killed in war and killings of rioting mobs.According toCharles Tilly, ""Altogether, about 100 million people died as a direct result of action by organized military units backed by one government or another over the course of the century.

"The planets of the Solar System and their moons were closely observed via numerousspace probes.Plutois discovered in 1930 on the edge of the Solar System, although in the early 21st century, it is reclassified as adwarf planetinstead of a planet proper, leaving eight planets."
"No trace of life is discovered on any of the other planets orbitingthe Sun(or elsewhere in the universe), although it remained undetermined whether some forms of primitive life might exist, or might have existed, somewhere in the Solar System.Extrasolar planetswere observed for the first time."
"Norman Borlaugfathered theGreen Revolution, the set of researchtechnology transferinitiatives occurring between 1950 and the late 1960s that increased agricultural production in parts of the world, beginning most markedly in the late 1960s, and is often credited with saving over a billion people worldwide from starvation."
"Geneticsis unanimously accepted and significantly developed. Thestructure of DNAis determined in 1953 byJames Watson,Francis Crick,Rosalind FranklinandMaurice Wilkins,following by developing techniques which allow to read DNA sequences and culminating in starting theHuman Genome Project(not finished in the 20th century) andcloning the first mammalin 1996."
"The role ofsexual reproductionin evolution is understood, andbacterial conjugationis discovered."
"The convergence of various sciences for the formulation of themodern evolutionary synthesis(produced between 1936 and 1947), providing a widely accepted account ofevolution."

Treatments for HIV remained inaccessible to many people living with AIDS and HIV indeveloping countries, and a cure has yet to be discovered."
"Because of increasedlife spans, theprevalenceof cancer,Alzheimer's disease,Parkinson's disease, and other diseases ofold ageincreased slightly."
"Changes in food production, along withsedentary lifestylesdue to labor-saving devices and the increase in home entertainment, contributed to an ""epidemic"" ofobesity, at first in the rich countries, but by the end of the 20th century spreading to the developing world."
Fossil fuelsandnuclear powerwere the dominant forms of energy sources.
"Widespread use of petroleum in industry—both as a chemical precursor to plastics and as a fuel for the automobile and airplane—led to the geopolitical importance of petroleum resources. The Middle East, home to many of the world's oil deposits, became a center of geopolitical and military tension throughout the latter half of the century. (For example, oil is a factor in Japan's decision to go to war against the United States in 1941, and the oil cartel,OPEC, used an oil embargo of sorts in the wake of theYom Kippur Warin the 1970s)."
"The increase infossil fuelconsumption also fueled a major scientific controversy over its effect on air pollution,global warming, and globalclimate change."

"Basichome appliancesincludingishing machines,clothes dryers, furnaces,exercise machines,dishishers,refrigerators, freezers,electric stovesandvacuum cleanersbecame popular from the 1920s through the 1950s. Radios were popularized as a form of entertainment during the 1920s, followed by television during the 1950s."
"The first airplane, theWright Flyer, is flown in 1903. With the engineering of the fasterjet enginein the 1940s, massair travelbecame commercially viable."
"Theassembly linemade mass production of the automobile viable. By the end of the 20th century, billions of people had automobiles for personal transportation. The combination of the automobile,motor boatsand air travel allowed for unprecedented personal mobility. In western nations, motor vehicle accidents became the greatest cause of death for young people. However, expansion ofdivided highwaysreduced the death rate."
"Thetriode tubeis invented, laying the foundation for amplification and switching technologies that led to silicon-basedsolid-state transistors, which revolutionized modern electronics."
"New materials, most notablystainless steel,Velcro,silicone,teflon, and plastics such aspolystyrene,PVC,polyethylene, and nylon came into widespread use for many various applications. These materials typically have tremendous performance gains in strength, temperature, chemical resistance, or mechanical properties over those known prior to the 20th century."
Aluminum became an inexpensive metal and became second only to iron in use.
Thousands ofchemicalswere developed for industrial processing and home use.
"Digital computers came into use, they greatly increased productivity and paved the way for theInternet, which revolutionized global communication and information sharing."
"TheSpace Racebetween the United States and theSoviet Uniongave a peaceful outlet to the political and military tensions of theCold War, leading to the firsthuman spaceflightwith the Soviet Union'sVostok 1mission in 1961, and man's first landing on another world—theMoon—with America'sApollo 11mission in 1969. Later, the firstspace stationis launched by theSoviet space program. The United States developed the first reusable spacecraft system with theSpace Shuttle program, first launched in 1981. As the century ended, a permanent crewed presence in space is being founded with the ongoing construction of theInternational Space Station."
"In addition to human spaceflight, uncrewed space probes became a practical and relatively inexpensive form of exploration. The first orbiting space probe,Sputnik 1, is launched by theSoviet Unionin 1957. Over time, a massive system of artificial satellites is placed into orbit around Earth. These satellites greatly advanced navigation, communications, military intelligence, geology, climate, and numerous other fields. Also, by the end of the 20th century, uncrewed probes had visited or flown by the Moon,Mercury,Venus,Mars,Jupiter,Saturn,Uranus,Neptune, and various asteroids and comets, withVoyager 1being the farthest manufactured object from Earth at 23,5 billion kilometers away from Earth as of 6 September 2022, and together withVoyager 2both carrying TheVoyager Golden Recordcontaining sounds, music and greetings in 55 languages as well as 116 images of nature, human advancement, space and society."

Economics is divided into two general economic schools: Keynesian and neoclassical
"The1970s energy crisisoccurred when theWestern world, particularly the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, faced substantial petroleum shortages as well as elevated prices. The two worst crises of this period were the1973 oil crisisand the1979 energy crisis, when, respectively, theYom Kippur Warand theIranian Revolutiontriggered interruptions inMiddle Easternoil exports."
